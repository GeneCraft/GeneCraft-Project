Installation
------------

This software has been tested on 
* Windows XP, Vista and Seven
* MacOSX 10.6
* Should work on Linux with some small changes

There's no proper build system, you have to find your way through the
compilation process.
First download the required dependencies :
* bulletphysics 
* Ogre3D 
* Qt 
* Qxt (only the 'core' part is needed)
* Qwt

Then modify the .pro to reflet your configuration
Then build it =)
