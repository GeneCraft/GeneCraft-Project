 * This sensor allows entities to know a distance between two fixations. Normally the
 * first fixation is the root fixation of the entity.
 *
 * We don't use global position because basiquely an entity can't know its position
 * into the world. Using this value can make different behavious between two same entities in
 * a different position in the world.
